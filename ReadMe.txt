A support vector machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning model that uses classification algorithms for two-group classification problems. After giving an SVM model sets of labeled training data for each category, they're able to categorize new text.
1. We will import the necessary libraries and matplotlib to plot the data and visualize.
2. We will then split the data into training data and test data. Test data is used to verify if our model is working after training the model.
3. We will scale the data
4. We will then move on to create a model and train it on the training data.
5. We will then verify the model by running and checking it on test set.
